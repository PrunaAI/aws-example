# aws-example
This repo is a example of how one can integrate `pruna` with aws ecosystem.

The notebook `triton_nlp_llama_pruna.ipynb` is based on [SageMaker example notebooks](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples), and demonstrate how to build, and deploy machine learning models using Amazon SageMaker.


## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup

The quickest setup to run example notebooks includes:
- An [AWS account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-account.html)
- Proper [IAM User and Role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/authentication-and-access-control.html) setup
- An [S3 bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-config-permissions.html)
